These are C++ tasks that I had to solve.
Below you can read the terms of the tasks.

1-Canteen
In the canteen, a single pie costs A som and B tyiyn. Your task is to calculate the total cost in
som and tyiyn for purchasing N pies. The input should be provided in the order of A, B, and N.

Sample input: 10 15 2 Sample output: 20 som and 30 tyiyn

2-Lucky ticket
A lucky ticket is a ticket with a six-digit number, where the sum of the first three digits is equal
to the sum of the last three. Those. ticket with number 385916 is lucky, because 3 + 8 + 5 = 9 +
1 + 6. You need to write a program that checks if the ticket is lucky. Print “YES” or “NO” for
the given number N.
Sample input: 385916 Sample output: YES

Odds : 3
Evens: 2

4-Next Prime
You are given a positive number N. Write a program that finds the next prime number greater
than N. To solve this problem, create and use an isPrime(N) function that checks if the number
N is prime or not.
